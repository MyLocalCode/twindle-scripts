# list-committers

We needed to fetch the list of people who have committed to the repository. This module solves this requirement.

## Playing with the code

There is a folder called `mock`. Inside there is an `index.js` file. You can run it by using `node index.js` in that `mock` folder. Some sample response is hardcoded there, so you can play around with it as much as you like, without worrying about github blocking your API access.

## Running the code

### Install node.js

<img src="https://nodejs.org/static/images/logos/nodejs-new-pantone-black.svg">

Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) from the official website and install it the same way as you install other software.

If you are facing any problems while installing node.js you can open up an issue in this repository.

### Additional information

The actual code running against the Github API is `index.js` file in the project root folder.

### Installing dependencies

You need to install dependencies using `npm install` when you clone for the first time.

### Actually running the code

You can then run it by using `node index.js` in the project root folder.

As always, suggestions are welcome.
