# list-committers

We needed to fetch the list of people who have committed to the repository. This module solves this requirement.

## Playing with the code

There is a folder called `mock`. Inside there is an `index.js` file. You can run it by using `node index.js` in that `mock` folder. Some sample response is hardcoded there, so you can play around with it as much as you like, without worrying about github blocking your API access.

## Running the code

The actual code running against the Github API is `index.js` file in the project root folder. You need to install dependencies using `npm install` when you clone for the first time. You can then run it by using `node index.js` in the project root folder.

As always, suggestions are welcome.
